tripwire
========

Tripwire is a poor man's alarm system. Tripwire will monitor your mouse and alert you in a variety of configurable ways. The idea is to use a wireless mouse as a sensor for movement, since wireless mice are affordable and some can even work from up to 30-50 feet away. When the mouse detects movement, tripwire plays an alarm-sounding wave file. Tripwire has trigger types such as HTTP, Sendmail (coming soon), and SMS(coming soon). Each of these trigger types tell Tripwire what to do when mouse movement is detected. 

How to detect movement
======================
Probably the easiest ways to get your mouse to detect movement is place a piece of paper below the mouse. For example, to detect if a door has been opened, tape a piece of paper to the door and place the other end of that paper underneath the mouse. The mouse of course will need to stay in place, so more tape would likely be needed for that accordingly. If you thought to yourself "Well geez that's cheesey", just remember: This is a POOR MAN'S alarm system.
